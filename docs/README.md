Documentation
=============

This is where in depth documentation will be going.

## Customization Options

Check out most of the customization options [here](CUSTOMIZATION.md).

## Events, Highlighting, Custom Selectors, and More!

All of this and more can be done via the decorator api. Please check out the [decorator documentation](DECORATORS.md).

## Custom Selectors and Colors

If you provide custom drawables or colors, you'll want to make sure they respond to state.
Check out the [documentation for custom states](CUSTOM_SELECTORS.md).

## TODO

Write and organize the documentation. Focus on customizability with real world scenarios.
